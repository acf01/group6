# group6
Hackathon project - 08-25-2018
This is our first real group project. We are tring to create a questionaire that outputs a personality based on answers given from three or four questions.
Currently, the HTML and CSS documents are the only files available. My team is working diligently on the Javascript which is the engine of
the project. We've got three hours left.
